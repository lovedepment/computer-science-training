      <p class="credits">The applets are little demonstration programs that clarify the topics in the book. <br>
      For example, to demonstrate sorting algorithms, a bar chart is displayed and, each time the user pushes a button on the applet, another step of the algorithm is carried out. Oner can see how the bars move, and annotations within the applet explain what's going on.</p>
